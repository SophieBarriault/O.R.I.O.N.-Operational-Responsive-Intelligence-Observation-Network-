## üåü About the Project

O.R.I.O.N. is a fully voice-activated desktop AI assistant designed to create a seamless and natural human-computer interaction experience through speech recognition, real-time response generation using large language models, and visual feedback via a graphical user interface. The project integrates speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and Hugging Face‚Äôs transformer-based NLP models to simulate an intelligent, responsive, and personalized AI system inspired by fictional virtual assistants like J.A.R.V.I.S. from Iron Man, MCU.

 - **The objective of O.R.I.O.N. is to:** 

 - Develop a continuously running desktop assistant that can detect a wake word ("Orion"), listen for commands, and generate meaningful, human-like responses.

  - Leverage modern NLP models (e.g., Mistral-7B) via Hugging Face for lightweight and efficient LLM integration without relying on OpenAI's API.

 - Provide clear visual feedback through a debug console and dynamic animated elements to enhance accessibility and user interaction.

 - Create a customizable foundation for further expansion into more advanced AI features, such as system control, file management, or smart home integration.

### üëæ Tech Stack

**Voice Interface:** 

 - SpeechRecognition ‚Äì For real-time voice input and speech-to-text conversion.

 - PyAudio ‚Äì Microphone audio capture.

 - pyttsx3 ‚Äì Offline text-to-speech (TTS) engine for natural voice responses.

**Natural Language Processing (NLP):** 

 - Hugging Face Transformers ‚Äì For hosting and interacting with LLMs (e.g., mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1).

 - huggingface_hub.InferenceClient ‚Äì Lightweight client for querying models without GPU dependency. 
 - (Previously supported: OpenAI GPT-4, now replaced for quota-free operation.)

**Graphical User Interface:** 

 - tkinter ‚Äì Built-in Python GUI toolkit for a lightweight debug console and visual feedback.

 - Pillow (PIL) ‚Äì For loading and animating GIFs inside the UI.

**Concurrency** 

 - threading ‚Äì To keep speech listening responsive while updating the GUI.

**Optional Enhancements:** 

 - Custom animated GIFs ‚Äì For a dynamic, sci-fi-inspired UI aesthetic.

 - Wake word detection ‚Äì Keyword-triggered listening loop (e.g., "Orion").

### üéØ Features

**Voice-Activated Wake Word:**
 - Automatically activates when you say "Orion", no buttons needed.

**Speech Recognition:** 
 - Converts your spoken words into text using SpeechRecognition and PyAudio.

**Conversational AI:** 
 - Processes questions and commands using Hugging Face‚Äôs Mistral-7B-Instruct model (fully customizable).

**Text-to-Speech Response:** 
 - ORION responds with a natural-sounding voice using pyttsx3.

**Dynamic UI Console:** 
 - Displays real-time updates, user inputs, and responses with animated GIF integration via tkinter.

**Continuous Listening Loop:** 
 - After responding, ORION returns to standby and waits for the next command.

**Customizable Wake Word & Voice Settings:** 
 - Easily change the assistant‚Äôs wake word, voice, rate, and language settings in the source code.

**Privacy-First:** 
 - No user data is stored by default. All processing is ephemeral unless logging is added intentionally.

<!-- FAQ -->
## :grey_question: FAQ

- **What is O.R.I.O.N.?** 

  + O.R.I.O.N. (Operational Responsive Intelligence Observation Network) is a Python-based desktop voice assistant inspired by J.A.R.V.I.S. It combines voice activation, natural language understanding via Hugging Face models, and a responsive GUI to perform tasks and respond intelligently to user queries. 

- **What can O.R.I.O.N. do?** 

  - O.R.I.O.N. can:

     - Listen for a wake word (‚ÄúOrion‚Äù)
 
     - Understand natural language commands
 
     - Respond verbally using TTS (text-to-speech)
 
     - Display a real-time debug console with an animated UI
 
     - Answer questions, tell jokes, and more using an LLM from Hugging Face


- **Does O.R.I.O.N. store any of my data?** 

  + No, by default O.R.I.O.N. does not store voice recordings or responses. You can optionally add logging if you wish to track conversations for debugging.
